# Dictionary
A set implemented in two ways (with a dynamic vector and with a hash table) to serve the purpose of a dictionary.

Given Problem
Find all words in a dictionary that can be formed with letters of a given word. Use the same letters, but not necessarily all of them. Letters can have different frequencies.

Solution
Implement a dynamic vector and a hashtable to serve as sets. Use basic insertions and lookups to solve the problem.

A detailed documentation explaining&comparing choices and a class diagram are attached ("Documentation.pdf", "diagram.jpg").
